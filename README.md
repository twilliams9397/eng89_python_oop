# Python OOP
- object oriented programming
- makes use of variable, methods and functions
- a method is a function called within a class
## Four Pillars of OOP
- Abstraction
- Inheritance
- Encapsulation
- Polymorphism
### Functions and good practice of functions
```python
# creating a function
# syntax def name_of_function(inputs) is used to declare a function

def greeting():
    print("Welcome on board, enjoy your trip!")
# pass can be used to skip without any errors

greeting() # function must be called to give output
```
- calling the above function will print out the string as the print statement is part of the function
- functions can also have a return function which returns variables which can later be called:
```python
def greeting():
    print("Good morning.")
    return "Welcome on board, enjoy your trip!"

print(greeting())
```
- this function will print the `"Good morning."` string then print the returned string afterwards
- the returned line is always what is outputted last from the function
- functions can take inputs from either the code or user inputs and run the code with this data:
```python
def greeting(name):
    return "Welcome on board " + name + "!"

print(greeting("Tom")) # this line is calling the function for "Tom"
```
```python
def greeting(name):
    return "Welcome on board " + name + "!"

print(greeting(input("What is your name?  ").capitalize()))
```
- functions can take multiple arguments
```python
def add(num1, num2):
    return num1 + num2

print(add(2, 3))
```
- this will return `5`
```python
def multiply(num1, num2):
    return num1 * num2
    print("this is the required outcome of two numbers") # this line will not execute as it is after return statement
    
print(multiply(3, 5))
```
- this will only return `15`, any required methods must come before the return statement
#### DRY Don't Repeat Yourself

### Python modules, packages and libraries
- modules contain built in functions and can be imported into a code script
- `import` is the key word used to import classes
```python
import math # imports whole class
from random import random # imports specific file from class

num1 = 23.44 # float

# have to round figure depending on value
# if value is less the .50 round down, if .50 or above round up

print(math.ceil(num1)) # rounds up to next integer
print(math.floor(num1)) # rounds down to next integer
print(math.pi)

# if specific file is imported it doesn't need to be called from class
print(random()) # random number between 0 and 1 everytime it is run
```
- imports can be used to get system and OS info, and also can be imported in groups
```python
import os # used to get information about your OS
import datetime, sys # sys is used to get system specific info

work_dir = os.getcwd() # provides current location/path
print(work_dir)
print(os.getuid()) # user id
print(os.cpu_count()) # reads hardware info - counts CPUs of machine
print(os.uname()) # returns username

print(datetime.date.today()) # today's date
print(sys.path) # absolute path
```
- requests is a package to interact with a live API - we can make an API call to any web address using python requests package
- packages must be explicitly installed if not available by default
- `pip install package_name` is the method in the console
```python
import requests # installed via pip method first
```
is done after `pip install requests`
- `pip -V` returns version
```python
requests_api = requests.get("https://www.bbc.co.uk/")
print(requests_api.status_code) # 200 for success, 404 and above for fail/unavailable
print(requests_api.headers) # allows access to website data
print(requests_api.content)
```
- ensure URL is exact - copy and paste
- can slice up data to get specifics
- can check data types with `type(data)`
- use `if` to check status code and ensure website is live before scraping any data

## Four Pillars
### Abstraction
- coding/programming is abstracted away from the user
- they don't need to see or know how the mechanisms work
### Inheritance
- create classes (child) that can inherit functions/methods from imported parent classes
- cuts out need for repetition by inheriting data - DRY
### Encapsulation
- restricted areas to authorised users, used to make data NOT publicly available
### Polymorphism
- "many forms", classes can change to add more functionality or update/add information
## Classes
- parent class (e.g. animal) with variables and behaviours (functions)
- sub classes (e.g. reptile, snake, python) will inherit everything from class above

1 animal.py file for animal class

2 reptile.py to abstract data and inherit from animal.py

3 snake.py

4 python.py and at this point we should be able to utilise inheritance from multiple classes - everything available from animal class to python
